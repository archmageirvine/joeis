  // Clement W. H. Lam describes a potentially more efficient approach.
  // Nevertheless the following was sufficient to verify the existing terms.

  // My approach:
  //
  // I work in rows rather than columns, so some of the concepts are around the
  // opposite dimension to that described in Lam.  In particular, we are
  // looking for the minimal number of rows.
  //
  // I generate the matrix one row at a time.  Each row is represented by a
  // single int with one bit per column.  Thus for a matrix of size n, the
  // possible values for row r range from 0 to 2^n-1.
  //
  // I assign an entire row at a time.  For each possible assignment, I check
  // if the assignment leads to column sums > 1 at every column, by either
  // the row itself is 2^n-1, or if in combination with a previous row this
  // is achieved.  If either is the case, then the 1-width of the matrix is at
  // most 2.  Since any remaining cells could be 0 or 1, it is easy to increment
  // the total count for the remaining matrix without any further computation.
  //
  // Otherwise the search must continue by deciding the content for next row.
  //
  // At the end, I can subtract the number of matrices for which a single row
  // suffices (since that is given by an easy formula in A005019(n)).
