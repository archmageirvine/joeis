 * A036027 Number of partitions of n into parts not of form 4k+2, 20k, 20k+7 or 20k-7. Also number of partitions in which no odd part is repeated, with at most 3 parts of size less than or equal to 2 and where differences between parts at distance 4 are greater than 1 when the smallest part is odd and greater than 2 when the smallest part is even.
