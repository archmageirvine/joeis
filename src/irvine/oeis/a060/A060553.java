/**
 * A060553 a(n) is the number of distinct (modulo geometric D3-operations) patterns which can be formed by an equilateral triangular arrangement of closely packed black and white cells satisfying the local matching rule of Pascal's triangle modulo 2, where n is the number of cells in each edge of the arrangement. The matching rule is such that any elementary top-down triangle of three neighboring cells in the arrangement contains either one or three white cells.
