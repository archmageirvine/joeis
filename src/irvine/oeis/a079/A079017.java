/**
 * A079017 Suppose p and q = p+14 are primes. Define the difference pattern of (p,q) to be the successive differences of the primes in the range p to q. There are 15 possible difference patterns, namely [14], [2,12], [6,8], [8,6], [12,2], [2,4,8], [2,6,6], [2,10,2], [6,2,6], [6,6,2], [8,4,2], [2,4,6,2], [2,6,4,2], [2,2,4,2,4], [2,4,2,4,2]. Sequence gives smallest value of p for each difference pattern, sorted by magnitude.
