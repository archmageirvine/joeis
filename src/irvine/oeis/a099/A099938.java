 * A099938 Consider the sequence of circles C0, C1, C2, C3 ..., where C0 is a half-circle of radius 1. C1 is the largest circle that fits into C0 and has radius 1/2. C(n+1) is the largest circle that fits inside C0 but outside C(n), etc. Sequence gives the curvatures (reciprocals of the radii) of the circles.
