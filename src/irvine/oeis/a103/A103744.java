/**
 * A103744 There are, up to equivalence (i.e., symmetries and rotations), 880 magic squares of order 4 (cf. A006052). Say that two squares are of the same type if one can be obtained from the other by complementing (replacing each entry i with 17-i) and applying symmetries. There are 12 types. Sequence gives the population of each of the types, arranged in nondecreasing order.
