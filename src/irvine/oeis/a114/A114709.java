 * A114709 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of hill-free Schroeder paths of length 2n that have k horizontal steps on the x-axis (0&lt;=k&lt;=n). A Schroeder path of length 2n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (2n,0) consisting of U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) steps and never going below the x-axis. A hill is a peak at height 1.
