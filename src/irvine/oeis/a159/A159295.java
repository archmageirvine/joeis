 * A159295 Number of ways that a tile in the form of a strip of n congruent regular hexagons stuck together on successive parallel edges can be surrounded by one layer of copies of itself in a plane. Ways that differ by rotation or reflection are not counted as different. The surrounded tile is the exact surrounded region.
