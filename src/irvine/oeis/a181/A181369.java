 * A181369 Number of maximal rectangles in all L-convex polyominoes of semiperimeter n. An L-convex polyomino is a convex polyomino where any two cells can be connected by a path internal to the polyomino and which has at most 1 change of direction (i.e., one of the four orientations of the letter L). A maximal rectangle in an L-convex polyomino P is a rectangle included in P that is maximal with respect to inclusion.
