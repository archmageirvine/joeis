/**
 * A182888 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k (1,0)-steps at level 0. These are paths of weight n that start at (0,0) , end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
