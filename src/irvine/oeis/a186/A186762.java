 * A186762 Number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having no increasing odd cycles. A cycle (b(1), b(2), ...) is said to be increasing if, when written with its smallest element in the first position, it satisfies b(1)&lt;b(2)&lt;b(3)&lt;... .  A cycle is said to be odd if it has an odd number of entries.
