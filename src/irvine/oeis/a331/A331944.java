/**
 * A331944 a(n)/ceiling(6^(n-7)) is the expected number of rolls of a fair 6-sided die in a game where the player starts at 0, advances the position by the outcome of the die's roll until exactly position n is reached. Positions beyond n are avoided by staying at the last visited position, but counting the rolls.
