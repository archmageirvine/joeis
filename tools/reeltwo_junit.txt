USAGE: 

java [JAVA_OPTIONS] junit.textui.ReelTwoTestRunner <testclass>


FUNCTIONALITY PROVIDED BY THIS TESTRUNNER:


1) Print the name of each test when being run

-Djunit.printNames=true


2) Print a summary of test execution time, sorted by time.

-Djunit.timing=true


3) Only execute tests with names matching supplied substring (exact
match only, no regexps)

-Djunit.testFilter=<substring>


4) Look for objects not cleared during teardown (to prevent memory
leaks during large runs).

-Djunit.residual=true

Some objects are not counted as leaks (char[], Object[], Vector,
TestSuite, String), mostly because they are created by the junit test
infrastructure itself.  Additional classnames to be excluded can be
read, one classname per line, from a file:

-Djunit.teardown.excludes=<filename>


5) Write out the names of failing tests to a file (to allow later
rerunning of only those tests).

-Djunit.writeFailures=true

Defaults to $HOME/.junit-test-failures
Override the name of the file to write with:

-Djunit.failureFile=<filename>

(You can later run rerun just those tests listed in the file by
invoking the ReelTwoTestRunner with the -f <filename> argument instead
of the name of a test class.)


6) Skip tests that take too long to run (based on historical timings)

-Djunit.timelimit=<num secs>

Stores timing information in $HOME/.junit-test-timings.props
Override the name of the file with:

-Djunit.timeFile=<filename>
